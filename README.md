4. **Create `.env.local` File**
   Create a new file called `.env.local` in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase API key:

This README file uses Yarn commands for installing Firebase CLI globally (`yarn global add firebase-tools`), installing project dependencies (`yarn install`), and running the project (`yarn start`).
